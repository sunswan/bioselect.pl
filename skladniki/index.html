              short-stemmed succulent plant which only grows to 80-100 cm
              (31-40 in) tall. The leaves are lanceolate, thick and fleshy,
              green to grey-green, with a serrated margin. The flowers are
              produced on a spike up to 90 cm (35 in) tall, each flower
              pendulous, with a yellow tubular corolla 2-3 cm long. Aloe Vera
              is relatively easy to care for in cultivation in frost-free
              climates. The species requires well-drained sandy potting soil

              world, both as an ornamental plant and for herbal medicine. Aloe
              Vera is used externally to treat various skin conditions such as

              The natural fat obtained from the fruit of karite tree,
              Butyrospermum parkii. Also called karite butter, it is widely
              used in moisturizers, suntan gels and creams, cleansing
              products, indoor tanning preparations, hair conditioners, hair
              tonics and lipsticks. Shea Butter is traditionally used in
              Africa not only as cooking oil but also as an anti-inflammatory
              for sprains and arthritis, healing salve and lotion for hair and
              skin care. Recently in clinical trials, Shea Butter was found to
              moisturize the epidermis and help to prevent wrinkle formation,
              soothe irritated skin and protect skin against climate and UV
              aggressions. Shea Butter also enhances cell regeneration and
              capillary circulation, which helps prevent and minimize stretch
              marks, inflammations, and scarring. The Plant &#8211; Shea Nut
              Butyrospermum parkii, Shea or Shea nut, (syn. Vitellaria
              paradoxa, B. paradoxa) is a tree indigenous to Africa, occurring
              in Mali, Cameroon, Congo, Côte d Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, Togo,
              Nigeria, Senegal, Sudan, Burkina Faso and Uganda. The shea fruit
              consists of a thin, tart, nutritious pulp that surrounds a
              relatively large, oil-rich seed from which is extracted shea
              butter. Shea trees take approximately 31 years to reach
              maturity. A traditional food plant in Africa, this little-known
              vegetable has potential to improve nutrition, boost food
              security, foster rural development and support sustainable land
              care. A number of steps are required to process the seed and
              obtain shea butter. First, the outer pulp is removed. Second,
              the shea nut is shelled; historically, shelling is done by
              mortar and pestle or by crushing the shell with stones; however,
              the Universal Nut Sheller is an appropriate technology that
              reduces a significant amount of labor involved in shelling shea.
              Once shelled, the seed is then roasted and either ground down or
              pressed to extract the oils that make shea butter.

              Extract of marigold has a soothing effect, is anti-inflammatory

              in the daisy family Asteraceae, native to the area from
              Macaronesia east through the Mediterranean region to Iran. It is
              the flower of the month October. The name Calendula stems from
              the Latin kalendae, meaning first day of the month, presumably
              because pot marigolds are in bloom at the start of most months
              of the year. The common name marigold probably refers to the
              Virgin Mary, or its old Saxon name ymbglidegold, which means it
              turns with the sun. Marigolds are considered by many gardening
              experts as one of the most versatile flowers to grow in a
              garden, especially since it is easy to grow. Seeds sown in the
              spring, in most soils, will germinate freely in sunny or
              half-sunny locations. They do best, however, if planted in sunny
              locations with rich, well-drained soil. The leaves are spirally
              arranged, 5-18 cm long, simple, and slightly hairy. The flower
              heads range from pastel yellow to deep orange, and are 3-7 cm
              across, with both ray florets and disc florets. They have a
              spicy aroma and are produced from spring to autumn in temperate
              climates. It is recommended to deadhead (removal of dying flower
              heads) the plants regularly to maintain even blossom production.
              The ointment of this herb is thought to cure a range of skin
              problems from burns to acne as it has properties that reduces
              inflammation, controls bleeding and soothes irritated tissue.
              Use internally or topically for minor wounds, eczemas and cysts
              as well as diaper rash and cradle cap in infants. Also, when
              planted near tomato plants in the garden, Marigolds help to
              reduce the presence of aphids. Marigold petals are considered
              edible. They are often used to add color to salads, and marigold
              extract is commonly added to chicken feed to produce darker egg
              yolks. Their aroma, however, is not sweet, and resembles the
              smell of hops in beer. The oil from its seed contains calendic
              acid.

              Green tea is a tropical Asiatic evergreen shrub or small tree
              with reddish or white flowers. Used to scent perfumes and in
              anti-wrinkle creams. Green tea has many beneficial effects and

              properties. It also contains tannins. In the skin care green tea
              is used for its anti-microbial and anti-oxidant properties.
              Green tea originates from China and has become associated with
              many cultures in Asia from Japan to the Middle East. Recently,
              it has become more widespread in the West, where black tea is
              traditionally consumed. Many varieties of green tea have been
              created in countries where it is grown. These varieties can
              differ substantially due to variable growing conditions,
              processing and harvesting time. Over the last few decades green
              tea has been subjected to many scientific and medical studies to
              determine the extent of its long-purported health benefits, with
              some evidence suggesting regular green tea drinkers may have
              lower chances of heart disease and developing certain types of
              cancer. Green tea has also been claimed useful for weight loss
              management.

              Ylang Ylang (Canaga Odorata) Ylang-ylang, Cananga odorata, is a
              small flower of the cananga tree. It is a fast-growing tree that
              exceeds 5 meters per year and attains an average height of 12
              meters. It grows in full or partial sun, and prefers the acidic
              soils of its native rainforest habitat. The leaves are long,
              smooth and glossy. The flower is greenish yellow (rarely pink),
              curly like a starfish, and yields a highly fragrant essential
              oil. A related species is Cananga fruticosa, which is a dwarf
              ylang-ylang that grows as small tree or compact shrub with
              highly scented flowers. Ylang-ylang has been cultivated in
              temperate climates under conservatory conditions. Its fruit are
              an important food item for birds, such as the Collared
              Imperial-pigeon, Purple-tailed Imperial-pigeon, Zoe s
              Imperial-pigeon, Superb Fruit-dove, Pink-spotted Fruit-dove,
              Coroneted Fruit-dove, Orange-bellied Fruit-dove, and Wompoo
              Fruit-dove (Frith et al. 1976). The name ylang-ylang is derived
              from Tagalog, either from the word ilang, meaning
              &#8220;wilderness&#8221;, alluding to its natural habitat, or
              the word ilang-ilan, meaning &#8220;rare&#8221;, suggestive of
              its exceptionally delicate scent. The plant is native to the
              Philippines and Indonesia and is commonly grown in Polynesia,
              Melanesia and Micronesia. The fragrance of ylang-ylang is rich
              and deep with notes of rubber and custard, and bright with hints
              of jasmine and neroli. The essential oil of the flower is
              obtained through steam distillation of the flowers and separated
              into different grades (extra; 1; 2; 3) according to when the
              distillates are obtained. The main aromatic components of
              ylang-ylang oil is benzyl acetate, linalool and p-cresyl methyl
              ether and methyl benzoate, responsible for its characteristic
              odor. The essential oil of ylang-ylang is used in aromatherapy.
              It is believed to relieve high blood pressure, normalize sebum
              secretion for skin problems, and is considered to be an
              aphrodisiac. According to Margaret Mead, it was used as such by
              South Pacific natives such as the Solomons where she did much of
              her research. The oil from ylang-ylang is widely used in
              perfumery for oriental or floral themed perfumes. Ylang-ylang
              blends well with most floral, fruit and wood smells. In
              Indonesia, ylang-ylang flowers are spread on the bed of newlywed
              couples. In the Philippines, its flowers, together with the
              flowers of the sampaguita, are strung into a necklace and worn
              by women and used to adorn religious images.

              Beeswax is a natural wax produced in the bee hive of honey
              bees.Western honey bees use the beeswax to build honeycomb cells
              in which their young are raised and honey and pollen are stored.
              Typically, for a honey bee keeper, 10 pounds of honey yields 1
              pound of wax. Its main components are palmitate, palmitoleate,
              hydroxypalmitate and oleate esters of long-chain (30-32 carbons)
              aliphatic alcohols. Beeswax was ancient man&#8217;s first
              plastic, and for thousands of years has been used as a modeling
              material, to create sculpture and jewelry molds for use in the
              lost-wax casting process. Lost-wax casting of metals, practised
              by ancient Greeks and Romans, involved coating of a wax model
              with plaster, melting the wax out of the resulting mould and
              filling the space with molten metal. The technique is still used
              today by jewellers, goldsmiths and sculptors, in dentistry and
              even in the industrial manufacture of complex components by
              investment casting of metals. More recently it found use as a
              component of sealing wax, and as emulsifier in cosmetics. It is
              often mixed with other ingredients such as olive oil. Our top
              quality beeswax is derived from the bees that live on the high
              mountains of Crete in a clean environment rich in aromatic
              herbs.

            <div class="plsc-toggle-content">
              The bergamot is a small and roughly pear-shaped fragrant citrus
              fruit native to Calabria Italy. Bergamot grows on small trees
              which blossom during the spring. Bergamot peel is used in
              perfumery for its ability to combine with an array of scents to
              form a bouquet of aromas which complement each other.
              Approximately one third of all men&#8217;s and about half of
              women’s perfumes contain bergamot essential oil. Bergamot was a
              component of the original Eau de Cologne developed in 17th
              century Germany &#8211; in 1704 the bergamot was first used to
              make the now famous &#8220;Eau de toilette&#8221; from the
              bergamot fruit by scooping out the pulp and squeezing the peel
              into sponges. Bergamot has been used for hundreds of years for
              acne, boils, cold sores, eczema, insect bites, insect repellent,
              oily complexion, psoriasis, scabies, spot varicose veins, skin
              ulcers, wounds, sore throat, thrush, infectious disease, and
              depression. Its traditional uses are antiseptic, deodorant,
              perfume, soothing agent, skin conditioner.

              Citrus aurantium dulcis (orange) peel oil is the oil from the
              fruit of the sweet orange (Citrus aurantium dulcis &#8211; also
              known as Citrus sinensis). It is classed as a biological product
              and is used as a miscellaneous skin-conditioning agent as well
              as a fragrance ingredient. It is used for its content in alpha
              hydroxy acids. AHA&#8217;s can be used as water-binding agents
              in cosmetics, but are mostly used in modern cosmetics for their
              exfoliating properties and their therapeutic properties which
              help with and minimize photo damaged skin, which is a major
              contributing factor to ageing. Many a clinical reference and
              much research has indicated the positive effect that the correct
              application of alpha hydroxy acids can have on the skin, and
              they can be a great boon to promoting younger looking skin and
              to minimizing the effect of ageing. Apart from ridding the skin
              of unnecessary dead cells, AHAs also have a moisturizing effect
              on the skin, by increasing the moisture content of the upper
              skin and so smoothing out fine lines and wrinkles, as well as
              reducing dryness and combating flakiness. Long-term use of low
              concentration AHA&#8217;s can also increase collagen and elastin
              synthesis, and also boost protein regeneration in the skin. They
              are also very effective in dealing with hyper-keratinization
              (over thickening of the skin), as well as increasing the
              epidermal thickness and have dermal glycosaminoglycans content.

              all eukaryotic cell membranes. Glycolipids when applied on the

              juice, with salt, pepper, asafetida and molasses, is taken as a
              remedy for biliousness. The heated leaves are applied to cracks

            <div class="plsc-toggle-content">
              A moderate purplish red that is paler than magenta rose. It is
              used for its anti-inflammatory properties as well as emollient
              and astringent. The Plant- Mallow (Malva sylvestris) a species
              of Malva native to Europe (the British Isles and Iberia north to
              southern Scandinavia and east to Russia and the Caucasus),
              northern Africa (Morocco east to Egypt), and Asia (western and
              southwestern Asia, central Asia east to Kyrgyzstan, and east
              along the Himalaya to Bhutan). It is a herbaceous annual,
              biennial, or perennial plant growing to 1-1.5 m (rarely 3 m)
              tall, with hairy stems and foliage. The leaves are alternate,
              palmately lobed, 2-10 cm long and 2-10 cm broad with three to
              seven shallow, rounded lobes and a serrated margin. The flowers
              are produced in clusters of two to six in the leaf axils, each
              flower 2-5 cm diameter, with five dark pink to purplish petals
              with a notch at the apex. The fruit is a disc-shaped schizocarp
              5-8 mm diameter, containing 10-12 seeds, the seeds individually
              enclosed in a usually glabrous (occasionally hairy) mericarp. It
              has a chromosome count of 2n=42. Plants with hairy seed
              mericarps have sometimes been distinguished as M. sylvestris
              var. lasiocarpa Druce, and small plants from high altitude in
              the Atlas Mountains have sometimes been distinguished as M.
              sylvestris subsp. subacaulis Maire, though neither is widely
              regarded as distinct. It occurs on dry, well-drained soils at
              altitudes from sea level up to 1,800 m in northern Europe and to
              3,000 m in northwest Africa, growing on open, sunny sites with
              little competition from other plants. The flowers are usually
              pollinated by bees. It is often grown as an ornamental plant for
              its attractive flowers, produced for a long period through the
              summer. Numerous cultivars have been selected and named. Plants
              previously often described as Malva sylvestris var. mauritiana
              are now considered a Cultivar Group Malva sylvestris Mauritiana
              Group. Like other species of the genus Malva, it is high in
              mucilage content. It was historically used medicinally,
              internally as a demulcent using a seed extract or boiled young
              leaves, and externally as an emollients, for which it is still
              in some use as a natural skin treatment. The species has long
              been used as a natural dye, and the French name of the species
              mauve was used for the English name of the first synthetic dye
              of similar colour, better known as mauveine, which lead to the
              word mauve as an English colour name. It has been introduced to
              and become naturalised in eastern Australia and North America.
              Other names sometimes used in cultivation included high mallow,
              tall mallow, wood mallow, wild mallow, cheese-flower,
              cheese-cake, pick-cheese, round dock, maul, and country-mallow.
              It is one of several species of different genera sometimes
              referred to as creeping charlie, a term more commonly applied to
              Glechoma hederacea (ground ivy). The young leaves and shoots of
              this plant have been eaten since at least the 8th century BC.
              The plant s many uses gave rise to the Spanish adage, &#8220;A
              kitchen garden and mallow, sufficient medicines for a
              home.&#8221; The flowers and leaves are emollient and good for
              sensitive areas of the skin. It is applied as a poultice to
              reduce swelling and draw out toxins. Taken internally, the
              leaves reduce gut irritation and have a laxative effect. When
              common mallow is combined with eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globulus),
              it makes a good remedy for coughs and other chest ailments. MAIN

              The Greek word for myrrh, μύρον, came to be synonymous with the
              word for &#8220;perfume&#8221;. In Ancient Rome myrrh was priced
              at five times as much as frankincense (the typical aromatic
              component of these days), though the latter was far more
              popular. It was said that the Roman Emperor Nero burned a year s
              worth of myrrh at the funeral of his wife, Poppaea. Pliny the
              Elder refers to myrrh as being one of the ingredients of
              perfumes, and specifically the &#8220;Royal Perfume&#8221; of
              the Parthians. He also says myrrh was used to fumigate wine jars
              before bottling.

              Myrtle A native of Mediterranean, the attractive plant has been
              a symbol of innocence for many centuries. In fact, Aphrodite,

              more apparent when one smells the clean, uplifting fragrance of
              Myrtle and the oil extracted from its flowers. The leaves and
              flowers were the major ingredients of &#8220;angel&#8217;s
              water&#8221;, a 16th century skin care lotion. The most
              important constituents of myrtle oil (up to 0.8% in the leaves)
              are myrtenol, myrtenol acetate, limonene and linalool. It is
              also used in folk medicine and reportedly relieves cramps, is
              relaxing in the bath and helps compat acne.

              The Olive is an evergreen tree or shrub native to the

              and rarely exceeds 8-15 meters in height. The silvery green
              leaves are oblong in shape, measuring 4-10 cm long and 1-3 cm
              wide. The trunk is typically gnarled and twisted. The small
              white flowers, with four-cleft calyx and corolla, two stamens
              and bifid stigma, are borne generally on the last year s wood,
              in racemes springing from the axils of the leaves. The fruit is
              a small drupe 1-2.5 cm long, thinner-fleshed and smaller in wild
              plants than in orchard cultivars. Olives are harvested at the
              green stage or left to ripen to a rich purple color (black
              olive). The olive is one of the plants most cited in recorded
              literature. In Homer s Odyssey, Odysseus crawls beneath two
              shoots of olive that grow from a single stock. The Roman poet,

              Obtained from the crust seed from a plant grown in Brazil. The
              Plant &#8211; Guarana The word guarana comes from the Portuguese
              guarana, which has its origins in the Satere-Mawe language word
              warana. Guarana plays an important role in Tupi and Guarani
              Brazilian culture. According to a myth dating back to the
              Satere-Maue tribe, guarana’s domestication originated with a
              deity killing a beloved village child. In order to console the
              villagers, a more benevolent god plucked the left eye from the
              child and planted it in the forest, resulting in the wild
              variety of guarana. The god then plucked the right eye from the
              child and planted it in the village, giving rise to domesticated
              guarana. The Guaranis would make this tea by shelling and
              washing the seeds, followed by pounding them into a fine powder.
              The powder is kneaded into a dough and then shaped into
              cylinders. This product is known as guarana bread or Brazilian
              cocoa, which would be grated and then immersed into hot water
              along with sugar. This plant was introduced to western
              civilization in the 17th century following its discovery by
              Father Felip Betendorf. By 1958, guarana was commercialized.
              Guarana is traditional used as stimulant but it also to treat
              chronic diarrhea, headache, depression, fatigue, and chronic
              diarrhea. Guarana is a stimulant of the central nervous system,
              blood circulation and respiration. Studies suggest that guarana
              improves the cognitive function and helps to reduce weight.
              Studies on humans showed that guarana improved alertness and
              memory performance. These cognitive improvements cannot only be
              attributed to high caffeine content and other phytochemicals may
              be involved. The fat burning effect of guarana is well known
              among athletes. Studies show that guarana has some effect on fat
              metabolism (higher muscle glycogen levels and lower lactate
              levels). This effect is associated with the methylxanthine
              content of guarana. Guarana reduces platelet aggregation thereby
              reducing the risk of stroke and heart attack. Several studies
              show that guarana extract decreases platelet thromboxane
              synthesis and inhibits platelet aggregation. Besides caffeine,
              guarana contains many phytochemicals with antioxidant activity,
              which helps to protect our cells. These phytochemicals have
              anti-cancer effect, reduce the toxicity of some chemicals such
              as alcohol and carcinogens and help to protect our DNA.

              The true Pelargonium graveolens is an uncommon species in the
              Pelargonium genus, which is native to South Africa, Zimbabwe and
              Mozambique, while the plants cultivated under this name (spelled
              P. &#8216;Graveolens&#8217;) differ from the wild specimens and
              are of hybrid origin (a probable cross between Pelargonium
              graveolens, P. capitatum and / or P. radens, or other closely
              related species). Often called a geranium, as it falls within
              the plant family Geraniaceae, and was previously categorised
              under the same genus. The common P. &#8216;Graveolens&#8217; or
              P. &#8216;Rosat&#8217; has great importance in the perfume
              industry. It is cultivated on a large scale and its foliage is
              distilled for its scent. P. &#8216;Graveolens&#8217; cultivars
              have a wide variety of smells, including rose, citrus, mint,
              coconut and nutmeg, as well as various fruits. However, the most
              commercially important varieties are those with rose
              scents.Pelargonium distillates and absolutes, commonly known as
              &#8220;geranium oil&#8221;, are sold for aromatherapy and
              massage therapy applications. They are also sometimes used to
              supplement or adulterate more expensive rose oils. The essential
              oil is an ingredient in a &#8220;natural&#8221; haemorrhoid

              avocado comes from the Spanish word aguacate, which derives in
              turn from the Nahuatl (Aztec) word ahuacatl, meaning
              &#8220;testicle&#8221;, because of its shape. In some countries
              of South America such as Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Peru, and
              Uruguay, the avocado is known by its Quechua name, palta. The
              tree grows to 20 metres (65 ft), with alternately arranged,
              evergreen leaves, 12-25 centimetres long. The flowers are
              inconspicuous, greenish-yellow, 5-10 millimetres wide. The
              pear-shaped fruit is botanically a drupe, from 7 to 20
              centimetres long, weighs between 100 and 1000 grams, and has a
              large central seed, 3 to 5 centimetres in diameter. A whole
              medium avocado contains approximately 15% of the United States
              FDAs recommended daily amount of fat, though they are high in
              monounsaturated fat. Avocados also have 60% more potassium than
              bananas. They are rich in B vitamins, as well as vitamin E and
              vitamin K. In avocado is found a fatty triol (fatty alcohol)
              with one double bond, avocadene (16-heptadecene-1,2,4-triol),
              which has been tested for anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory
              properties. These properties are likely related with the
              curative effects of avocado described for a number of ailments
              (diarrhea, dysentery, abdominal pains and high blood pressure).

              Leaf Extract*</span>
            <div class="plsc-toggle-content">
              A flavoring and perfume from the fresh aromatic flowering tops
              of the evergreen shrub grown in the Mediterranean. Widely used
              in hair products, bubble baths, body and hand preparations,
              lipsticks, suntan products, perfumes and bath soaps. The Plant
              Rosemary is a woody, perennial herb with fragrant evergreen
              needle-like leaves. It is native to the Mediterranean region. It
              is a member of the mint family Lamiaceae, which also includes
              many other herbs. Forms range from upright to trailing; the
              upright forms can reach 1.5 m tall, rarely 2 m. The leaves are
              evergreen, 2-4 cm long and 2-5 mm broad, green above, and white
              below with dense short woolly hairs. The flowers are variable in
              color, being white, pink, purple, or blue.The name rosemary has
              nothing to do with the rose or the name Mary, but derives from
              the Latin name rosmarinus, which literally means &#8220;dew of
              the sea&#8221;, though some think this too may be derived from
              an earlier name.The fresh and dried leaves are used frequently
              in traditional Mediterranean cuisine as a herb; they have a
              bitter, astringent taste, which complements oily foods, such as
              lamb and oily fish. A tisane can also be made from them. They
              are extensively used in cooking, and when burned give off a
              distinct mustard smell, as well as a smell similar to that of
              burning which can be used to flavor foods while
              barbecuing.Rosemary, in the dried form, is extremely high in
              iron, calcium, and Vitamin B6. It is in fact more nutrient rich
              in its dry form than fresh rosemary across the board.Since it is
              attractive and tolerates some degree of drought, it is also used
              in landscaping, especially in areas having a Mediterranean
              climate. It can in fact die in over-watered soil, but is
              otherwise quite easy to grow for beginner gardeners. It is very
              pest-resistant.Rosemary is easily pruned into shapes and has
              been used for topiary. When grown in pots, it is best kept
              trimmed to stop it getting too straggly and unsightly, though
              when grown in a garden, rosemary can grow quite large and still
              be attractive. It can be propagated from an existing plant by
              clipping a shoot 10-15 cm long, stripping a few leaves from the
              bottom, and planting it directly into soil.Rosemary infusion is
              used to lighten blond hair, to condition, tone and strengthen
              all hair. It can also be used as an invigorating toner and
              astringent. Rosemary used in the bath strengthens and refreshes,
              especially when used following an illness.Rosemary helps to
              relax muscles, including the smooth muscles of the digestive
              tract and uterus. Because of this property it can be used to
              soothe digestive upsets and relieve menstrual cramps. Finally,
              several studies done in the last several years show that oil
              from the leaves of the very plant can help prevent the
              development of cancerous tumors in laboratory animals.

              What is it? The most abundant ingredient in all cosmetic
              formulations is water. Not all cosmetics use the same water
              though. In our formulations we use the organic floral water
              (hydrosol) which is the water remaining after the distillation
              of Salvia Officinalis (Sage). Clinically, the chemical
              components in the hydrosol are natural acids, which are
              hydrophilic (water-loving). How does it work? Water is slightly
              acidified and this is beneficial to the skin and the body. Thus
              hydrosol acts as a healing anti-inflammatory and mild, but
              therapeutic antiseptic. Bacteria do not live well in acidic
              environments, which is why acidic liquids such as vinegar make
              good preservatives for food items like pickles, Chile peppers
              and Olives. Acidic environment is astringent thus the hydrosol
              is useful in skin care products because astringents constrict
              and contract your skin’s tissues.

              evergreen subshrub, with woody stems, grayish leaves, and blue
              to purplish flowers native to southern Europe and the
              Mediterranean region (Greek: faskomilo).It is much cultivated as
              a kitchen and medicinal herb, and is also called Garden sage,
              Kitchen sage, and Dalmatian sage. In southern Europe related
              species are sometimes cultivated for the same purpose, and may
              be confused with the common sage. Although this plant was the
              one originally called by this name sage, a number of related
              species are now also called by it, and are described in more
              detail in the article on sage. The uses and benefits ascribed to
              it are many and varied, and are often shared with related
              species. Uses of common sage include:infusions, which are
              considered to have a calming effect, to soothe a sore throat and
              as a digestive agent preservative flavourings, for instance of
              cheese as a cooking flavouring, such as in sage and onion
              stuffing as a deodorizer preparation used from the extracts of
              the herb . Common sage is also grown in parts of Europe,
              especially the Balkans for distillation of the essential oil,
              though other species, such as Salvia triloba may also be
              harvested and distilled with it. A number of cultivars of the
              plant exist. The majority of these are cultivated more often for
              ornament than for their herbal properties. All these are
              valuable as small ornamental flowering shrubs, and for low
              ground cover, especially in sunny dry situations. They are
              easily raised from summer cuttings. Named cultivars include
              &#8220;Purpurascens&#8221;, a purple-leafed cultivar, considered

              effectiveness of Common Sage is often open to debate, it has
              been recommended at one time or another for virtually every
              ailment. Modern evidence supports its effects as an
              antihydrotic, antibiotic, antifungal, astringent, antispasmodic,
              estrogenic, hypoglycemic, and tonic. In a double blind,
              randomized and placebo-controlled trial, sage was found to be
              effective in the management of mild to moderate Alzheimer&#8217;
              s disease.

            <div class="plsc-toggle-content">
              A natural flavoring ingredient from the flowers of the tree
              grown in Europe and US. Widely used in many cosmetics
              preparations. The extract from the linden blossoms is reputed to
              have soothing, hydrating and astringent properties. Linden
              extract is often prescribed for use in bath salts and creams to
              soothe irritated skin. The Plant &#8211; Linden (Tilia Cordata)
              The Tilia species grow in temperate climates in the north. They
              are deciduous trees (leaves shed seasonally) that can grow to a
              height of 90 feet and may live up to 1,000 years. Herbal linden
              flower formulas typically call for either Tilia cordata, the
              small-leafed European linden also known as the winter linden, or
              Tilia platyphyllos, the large-leafed, early-blooming summer
              linden. Both species are frequently planted as ornamental trees
              along city streets. Depending on the species, their fragrance
              ranges from potent and sweet to quite rich. The dried flowers
              are mildly sweet and sticky, and the fruit is somewhat sweet and
              slimy. Linden tea has a pleasing taste, due in part to the
              aromatic volatile oil found in the flowers. Linden, an herb
              derived from various species of Tilia, has been used in European
              folk medicine for centuries to treat a wide range of health
              problems. Tilia Cordata flowers is used in colds, cough, fever,
              infections, inflammation, high blood pressure, headache
              (particularly migraine), as a diuretic (increases urine
              production), antispasmodic (reduces smooth muscle spasm), and
              sedative. It also tones the venous (veins and capillary) system,
              while thinning the blood. Tilia cordata leaves is used to
              promote sweating (helpful for fevers), but decreases night
              sweats. Tilia cordata wood is used for liver and gallbladder
              disorders and cellulitis (inflammation of the skin and
              surrounding soft tissue). Tilia cordata charcoal is ingested to
              treat intestinal disorders and used topically to treat swelling
              (edema) or infection (such as cellulitis or ulcers) of the lower
              leg. It tones and help remove blemishes on the skin.

              Vitis vinifera (Grape) Fruit Extract*
            </span>
            <div class="plsc-toggle-content">
              Red Grape extract, rich in Polyphenols, is not only used in the
              cosmetics for its anti-ageing and anti-puffiness properties but
              also due to its nutrients can hydrate and replenish the skin and
              offer protective properties against the environment and
              pollution. The Fruit A grape is the non-climacteric fruit that
              grows on the perennial and deciduous woody vines of the genus
              Vitis. Grapes can be eaten raw or used for making jam, juice,
              jelly, vinegar, wine and grape seed oil. Compounds such as
              resveratrol (a polyphenol antioxidant) have been discovered in
              grapes and these have been positively linked to fighting cancer,
              heart disease, degenerative nerve disease and other ailments.
              Resveratrol is found in wide amounts among grape varieties,
              primarily in their skins and seeds which, in muscadine grapes,
              have about one hundred times higher concentration than pulp.
              Anthocyanins tend to be the main polyphenolics in red grapes
              whereas flavan-3-ols (e.g., catechins) are the more abundant
              phenolic in white varieties. Total phenolic content, an index of
              dietary antioxidant strength, is higher in red varieties due
              almost entirely to anthocyanin density in red grape skin
              compared to absence of anthocyanins in white grape skin. Since
              the 1980s, biochemical and medical studies have demonstrated
              powerful antioxidant properties of grape seed oligomeric
              proanthocyanidins. Together with tannins, polyphenols and
              polyunsaturated fatty acids, these seed constituents display
              inhibitory activities against several experimental disease
              models, including cancer, heart failure and other disorders of
              oxidative stress. Grape seed oil from crushed seeds is used for
              many perceived health benefits.
